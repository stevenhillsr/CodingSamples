samples of my work

This is where I intend to build a portfolio of sorts to provide samples of my work.

I anticipate having folders for different "categories" of work.
To start with, I have a php folder that contains a ZendFramework1 folder and a Drupal7
folder which each contain examples of work done in those environments
